## Vibe Garden README

### What did you build?
A note-taking website where the user can write down notes, to-do lists, thoughts, and other ideas in the form of planting plants. 

### What language(s) or tools did you use?
Languages: HTML, JavaScript, CSS

### Which AI tools did you use, and how?
AI Tools: Claude, ChatGPT, Codeium, Microsoft Copilot.
ChatGPT helped formulate the idea, Claude wrote most of the code, Codeium refactored and organized it, and Microsoft Copilot helped with finishing touches.

### What did you do versus what AI helped with?
I refined the idea, added special features, and implemented some extra CSS so it would appear how I wanted (visually).

### Whatâ€™s one thing youâ€™re proud of?
The idea itself. I like to write things down so I don't forget them, and this is a way to store all my thoughts in a fun and interactive way in a relaxing atmosphere.

### Whatâ€™s one thing youâ€™d improve with more time?
I would fix the bee animation. It doesn't turn to face the direction it's flying in, so it looks like it's flying backwards. I would also add features where you can water your plants and add growing animations.
